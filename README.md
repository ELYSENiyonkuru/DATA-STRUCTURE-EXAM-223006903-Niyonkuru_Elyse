Here is an overview of each topic with insights into its relevance and implementation for an online car sales and financing platform:
________________________________________
Topic 1: Define Data Structures and Discuss Their Importance
Key Points:
•	Data structures like arrays, linked lists, trees, and hash tables organize and manage data efficiently.
•	Importance in online car sales: 
o	User data management (e.g., customer profiles, preferences).
o	Inventory tracking (e.g., available cars, pricing, features).
o	Order processing (e.g., payment status, delivery tracking).
o	Search and retrieval (e.g., quick search for specific car models).
o	Scalability: Ensures the platform performs well as data grows.
•	Choosing the right data structure ensures: 
o	Faster operations (search, insert, delete).
o	Optimal resource utilization.
o	Scalability for future requirements.

Topic 2: Implement Binary Search Tree (BST) and Doubly Linked List
Use Case:
•	BST: Ideal for managing searchable data, like car inventory sorted by price or mileage.
•	Doubly Linked List (DLL): Efficient for bidirectional traversal, e.g., browsing recent searches or car comparisons.
Implementation:
1.	BST: 
o	Nodes contain car details (e.g., price, model, year).
o	Supports operations like search, insert, delete, and range queries.
2.	DLL: 
o	Nodes store links to previous and next elements.
o	Useful for maintaining a list of recently viewed cars or loan application steps.

Topic 3: Implement Circular Queue
Use Case:
•	Manage real-time processing tasks such as: 
o	Customer inquiries.
o	Loan approval requests.
o	Vehicle dispatch queues.
Features:
•	Circular nature prevents unused space.
•	Efficient for fixed-size task scheduling.
Implementation:
•	Enqueue new tasks (e.g., adding a new inquiry).
•	Dequeue tasks for processing (e.g., serving inquiries in FIFO order).

Topic 4: Create Binary Search Tree to Manage a Fixed Number of Orders
Use Case:
•	Limit order history display (e.g., last 100 orders).
•	BST ensures orders are kept in sorted order (e.g., by date or amount).
Implementation:
•	BST stores a fixed number of nodes.
•	When the limit is reached, the least-priority node (e.g., oldest order) is removed.

Topic 5: Use Binary Search Tree to Track Data Dynamically
Use Case:
•	Dynamically track data such as: 
o	Active loan applications.
o	Cars available for sale.
•	BST supports dynamic insertions and deletions while maintaining order.
Benefits:
•	Allows quick range queries (e.g., find cars within a price range).
•	Efficiently adapts to real-time updates.

Topic 6: Implement a Tree to Represent Hierarchical Data
Use Case:
•	Represent and manage hierarchical relationships, such as: 
o	Car categories (SUV, sedan, hatchback).
o	User roles (admin, dealer, customer).
Implementation:
•	A general tree where each node can have multiple children.
•	Supports operations like traversal to fetch subcategories or permissions.

Topic 7: Use Radix Sort to Sort Data Based on Priority
Use Case:
•	Efficiently sort large datasets based on numeric or alphanumeric keys, such as: 
o	Order priorities.
o	Loan approval sequences.
Features:
•	Radix sort is non-comparative, making it faster for fixed-length data.
•	Ideal for sorting based on multi-level keys (e.g., customer ID, car price).
